## Color Detection image Project

## üìù Description
 In this color detection Python project, the aim is to build an application through which you can automatically get the name of the color by clicking on them in the picture. So for this, we will have a data file that contains the color name and its values. Then we will calculate the distance from each color and find the shortest one.
